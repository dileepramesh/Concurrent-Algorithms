This submission includes the code for the following 2 algorithms:

1. Running Lamport's bakery algorithm
2. Running Lamport's fast mutual exclusion algorithm

The following files have been included:

1. Fast.py - Implements Lamport's fast mutual exclusion algorithm
2. Bakery.py - Implements Lamport's bakery algorithm
3. main.py - Driver program for (1) and (2)
6. Log - Contains sample output from running algorithms (1) and (2)

How to run the programs
-----------------------

python3.2 main.py 10 100

Algorithm Description
---------------------

 - The main.py driver program does the following:
   - Get the 'n' and 'm' parameters from user. Set default values if not given.
   - Execute Bakery Algorithm
     - Print a message indicating the above
     - Initialize the thread_list
     - Initialize the individual threads
     - Assign requests to threads in a random fashion
     - Call the setup routine to initialize the shared variables and start the threads
   - Execute Fast Mutual Exclusion Algorithm
     - Print a message indicating the above
     - Initialize the thread_list
     - Initialize the individual threads
     - Assign requests to threads in a random fashion
     - Call the setup routine to initialize the shared variables and start the threads

 - The Bakery.py and Fast.py class files have the following sections:
   - cs(): Contains the CS request, entry and exit code blocks
   - main(): Contains the CS task that is passed to cs(). This will loop through 
             the list of requests and call cs() till all the requests are exhausted.
   - run(): Thread start routine. Simply calls main()
